HOW TO USE ALPANO ?

 • Introduction 
  
The purpose of this project is to represent panoramas of mountains mainly in Switzerland (and a part of France and Italy).
In this application, the user has to choose many characteristics of an observer (as his position, in which direction he is oriented, etc.), but also some characteristics about the image of the panorama he wants (its height and width). 
All of this, to display a realistic panorama that one would see in the given situation.

 • How to use the main content 
	
   * Enter the coordinate of a panorama : 
   		At the bottom of the window, the user can put all the information of a panorama he wants to see. Those informations are bounded, so the user should not be surprised if the data he entered are slightly adapted, in case they were out of bounds (they will be round to the nearest valid value).
   		Also it is highly recommended to first check plausible value (for longitude, latitude, etc.) on google map or openStreetMap for a better use of the application.
   		
   * Compute a panorama :
   		Once the parameters are settled (and if they are different from the last panorama computed), a message will appear and will propose to compute the new panorama. After the user click on it, the program will compute the new panorama and the application will momentarily be frozen.
   
   * Search location using openStreetMap
   		If a panorama is displayed, the user can click on a location and a web page will open. The location clicked will appear in openStreetMap.
   		
   * Have information on points of the panorama
   		Still if a panorama is displayed, the user can have informations about the point where the mouse is situated on the bottom right of the program.
